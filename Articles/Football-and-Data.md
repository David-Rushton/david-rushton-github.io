# Football and Data

I recently started a [new project](https://github.com/David-Rushton/Football).  For the moment it is called Football, although I'm hoping a moment of inspiration will deliver a better name.  The project has two goals:

1. Learn a new programming language
1. Gain an appreciation for the work data scientists do

I love nothing more than buying a big programming book, settling into my sofa and learning a new language.  I had wanted to learn [Phyton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).  Both are widely used by a plethora of professions with data in their job title (data scientists, data analysts, data journalist and data miners), as well as statisticians.  However as a father of two small adorable children; I don't have the time I used to.  In the end, I decided R presented the biggest challenge and would, therefore, be the most rewarding.  Python's object-oriented nature is closer to the languages I already know.  After a little window shopping, I purchased [R in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action-second-edition), published by Manning (ISBN 9781617291388).  I'm roughly a quarter of the way through and am thoroughly enjoying the ride.

Recently a number of my favourite podcasts have included episodes on data science.  This is no surprise; data science and data scientists are a hot topic right now.  While listening to these talented people discussing new and exciting concepts; it struck me that this is an area of the data world I'm not familiar with.  As the manager of a data warehouse, it is only a  matter of time before I find myself working along a data scientist.  With that in mind, I thought it would be helpful to learn the basics.

So on to the project itself.  I wanted a large data set I could play with.  After a little searching, I stumbled across the excellent [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/).  From the website:

> The goal of the football-data API is to provide football data of all major leagues in a machine-readable way.
> All data is provided through a reliable, intuitive and well-documented REST API with JSON representation.

My plan is to split the project into two mini-projects.  The first is a [PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_modules?view=powershell-6) that will provide [cli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) access to the rich data set available via the API.  The second will be an R project.  The goals of this second project are a little vague at the moment.  That's ok.  I want to finish reading R in Action first.

The PowerShell module is a work in progress.  One thing that stood out: the tooling and support available to PowerShell devs, particularly in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/powershell) is amazing.  I'll talk more about this another day. 

David.
